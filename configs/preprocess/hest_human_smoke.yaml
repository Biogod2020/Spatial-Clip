# HEST human smoke run: 2-3 lightweight Homo sapiens slides for fast end-to-end tests
# Inherit all defaults then override only what we need.
defaults:
  - default
  - _self_

# Use a dedicated dataset key so intermediate/output artifacts are isolated
# under data/*/<dataset.key>.
dataset:
  key: hest_v1_smoke
  description: "Spatial-CLIP smoke run (selected Homo sapiens slides)"

# Reuse the canonical HEST raw directory but write outputs into
# data/processed[_intermediate]/hest_v1_smoke.
source:
  raw_data_dir: ${paths_layout.raw_root}/hest_v1

# Keep the same global HGNC/HVG resources from the parent config.
# Intermediate/output dirs are derived from dataset.key automatically.

params:
  general:
    species_filter: "Homo sapiens"

  # Explicitly whitelist the exact slides we want to keep runtime predictable.
  samples_allowlist:
    - TENX158  # FFPE human skin melanoma (~2k spots)
    - TENX157  # FFPE human prostate adenocarcinoma (~4k spots)
    - NCBI883  # Xenium healthy lung (~1.2k spots)

performance:
  limit_samples: -1   # allowlist already enforces the subset
  max_workers: 4      # modest parallelism to stay laptop-friendly
